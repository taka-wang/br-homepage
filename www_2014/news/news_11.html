                                    Bend Broadband today announces the launch of HSPA+ service provided via BandRich’s BandLuxe R305 router and C325 USB modem. Bend Broadband, a new organization of Bend Cable, the family-owned cable operator in Oregon, now starts the wireless broadband services with the highest data throughput technology available in the state of the art.
                                    <br><br>
                                    HSPA+ is the next evolution of high-speed packet access (HSPA) wireless broadband technology with greater efficiency and data throughput improvement compared to current 3G networks. Bend Broadband takes the advantage as a new AWS band licensed operator and deploys the most advanced HSPA+ wireless technology for its network. Bend Broadband cooperates with BandRich, a Taiwanese 3.5G/4G device design & manufacturer, and launches HSPA+ WiFi router (R305) as well as USB modem (C325). Both devices enable the broadband services in AWS band and will dramatically help expand the Bend Broadband’s service footprint in Central Oregon.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BandLuxe R305 provides the fast and reliable solution for wireless networking anywhere. It’s easy to share 3.5G broadband access by simply inserting the SIM card and connecting multiple wired or wireless devices to internet with data rate downlink up to 21Mbps and uplink up to 5.7Mbps. BandLuxe R305 integrates HSPA+ technology and WiFi router technology into one stylish unit. This Router incorporates a WLAN 802.11b/g/pre-n access point, and an Ethernet 10/100Mbps port. It features the latest security options such as WPA data encryption, SPI Firewall and VPN pass through.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BandLuxe R305 has built-in antennas for both HSPA/HSPA+ and WiFi functions. Such embedded design makes its appearance neat and stylish. At insufficient 3G coverage area, an optional 3G antenna can be used with R305 to further extend the broadband services.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BendBroadBand and BandRich also debut BandLuxe C325, the newest HSPA+ USB modem which nearly triples the speed of other mobile broadband devices, with peak download speeds of 21Mbps and uplink speed of 5.7Mbps. The C325 is designed for North American and Asia-Pacific regions, operating at the AWS band and 2100 MHz band. BandLuxe C325 supports most operating systems in computers – Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, etc.
                                    <br><br>
                                    BandRich leverages its leadership in AWS band product development and deployment to help Bend Broadband be first-to-market with the fastest data speeds and the most attractive mobile Internet services.
