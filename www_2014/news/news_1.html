                                Taipei, Taiwan, April 16th ??BandRich Inc. today announced the launch of its BandLuxe® C100 ExpressCard HSDPA data modem. Foreseeing the generation change of ExpressCard interface replacing the traditional PCMCIA interface in all new laptops, the BandLuxe® C100 is designed for ExpressCard/34 interface with optional USB and PCMCIA adaptors to support incumbent computers. The compact data card is certified by Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) and supports laptops or desktops with Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Linux, and later the Mac OS X.
                                <br><br>
                                The BandLuxe® C100 supports WCDMA/HSDPA triple bands (2100/850/1900) and has been proven to reach up to 7.2Mbps downlink in live networks. In areas without 3G coverage, it works under GSM/GPRS/EDGE quad bands (850/900/1800/1900). With the BandLuxe® C100, users can enjoy high-speed Internet surfing on their computers worldwide. The featured receive diversity antenna improves wireless signal reception, enables higher data transmission rates, and saves downlink capacity for more users. Moreover, the BandLuxe® C100 reserves an external antenna plug for better reception at fringe or weak signal areas.
                                <br><br>
                                The user-friendly design of the BandLuxe® C100 facilitates a CD-free installation process. End users simply plug in the BandLuxe® C100 data modem and are a few clicks away from enjoying mobile high-speed data. The BandLuxe® C100 also provides the option of " always-on connection ", which allows users to automatically connect to the Internet when they boot up their computers. Furthermore, the BandLuxe® C100 users have flexibility in choosing band selection (Asia and Europe only, or North America only) and radio mode selection (2G/3G dual mode, or 3G only), allowing for shorter search time for base station coverage. SMS and long SMS (up to 15 concatenated messages) services are supported, which facilitate the computer to become a powerful messaging machine.
