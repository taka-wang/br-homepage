                                    <br><br>
                                    The BandLuxe® C120 is designed for compact USB stick form-factor. Measuring only 88x28x17.4mm, it can be carried comfortably in the pocket, without the hassle of USB extension cable. For use with desktop or laptop at home, in the office, or on the road, the BandLuxeR C120 provides Far EasTone customers with plug-and-play mobile broadband access for internet surfing, emailing and instant message chatting.

                                    The user-friendly design of the BandLuxe® C120 facilitates a CD-free installation process. The client applications, drivers and manual will be installed automatically when the device connected to the computer for the first time. The operator connection settings would be automatically configured via recognizing the USIM inserted.
